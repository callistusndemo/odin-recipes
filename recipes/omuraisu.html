    <h1>Omuraisu (Japanese Rice Omelet)</h1>

    <p>
      Omuraisu is similar in flavor and style to hash browns and eggs. This
      delicious Japanese rice omelet works wonderfully as a breakfast, lunch, or
      dinner, especially for those not ready for the traditional raw fish or
      white rice.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 cup cooked white or brown rice</li>
      <li>2 thin slices cooked ham, cubed</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons ketchup, divided</li>
      <li>1 slice processed cheese food (such as Velveeta) (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Â¼ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a skillet over medium heat; coat with cooking spray. Add cooked
        rice, ham, 2 tablespoons ketchup, and cheese; cook and stir until well
        combined and heated through, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a serving
        bowl; shape into an oval.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Heat a small
        skillet over medium heat; coat with cooking spray. Add egg mixture; cook
        until eggs start to set. Lift edges, letting uncooked portion run
        underneath. Gently fold eggs, using a spatula, into a cocoon shape.
        Remove from heat when eggs are completely set.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place omelet on top of rice; run a knife lengthwise through top layer of
        omelet to open like a butterfly and drape over rice. Top with remaining
        1 tablespoon ketchup; sprinkle with parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
