    <h1>Tonkatsu (Japanese Pork Chop)</h1>

    <p>
      This Tonkatsu recipe uses thinly sliced boneless pork chops and panko,
      which are Japanese bread crumbs that are really light and airy.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon milk</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>8 thin cut boneless pork chops</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups panko crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine eggs, milk, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until well
        mixed. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place
        panko crumbs in a shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip pork chops in egg mixture, then coat with panko crumbs; dip in the
        egg mixture again, then coat with another layer of panko crumbs. Lay
        coated chops on a plate until the rest are finished. If you have time,
        let them set for about 10 minutes, and the coating will set very well.
      </li>
      <li>
        When oil is very hot, place pork chops into the pan, and fry for about 5
        minutes on each side, until golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
